**Multiple Disease Prediction**
-------------------------------

This is a **Multiple Disease Prediction** system, a Streamlit web application that uses machine learning to predict a person's risk for heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes.

**How it Works:**

The application is a simple tool for early disease detection. Users enter their medical data, like blood pressure or glucose levels. The app then uses pre-trained machine learning models to analyze this information and predict the person's risk for a specific disease.

**Technologies Used:**

*   **Python:** The main programming language.
    
*   **Streamlit:** Used to create the web interface.
    
*   **Scikit-learn:** Provides the machine learning models.
    
*   **Pandas & NumPy:** Used for handling and processing data.
    

**Key Features:**

*   It predicts heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes.
    
*   The interface is interactive and easy to use.
    
*   It has simple forms for entering medical information.
    

**How to Run the Application:**

1.  Clone the project from GitHub.
    
2.  Go into the project folder.
    
3.  Install the required libraries with the command: pip install -r requirements.txt.
    
4.  Start the app with the command: streamlit run app.py.
    
5.  The application will automatically open in your web browser.
