**Multiple Disease Prediction**
-------------------------------

**How it Works:**The application is a simple tool for early disease detection. Users enter their medical data, like blood pressure or glucose levels, into the system. The application then uses pre-trained machine learning models to analyze the data and predict the person's risk for the chosen disease.

**Technologies Used:**

*   **Python:** The main programming language.
    
*   **Streamlit:** Used to build the web interface.
    
*   **Scikit-learn:** Provides the machine learning models.
    
*   **Pandas & NumPy:** Used for handling and processing data.
    

**Key Features:**

*   Predicts heart disease.
    
*   Predicts Parkinson's disease.
    
*   Predicts diabetes.
    
*   The interface is interactive and easy to use.
    
*   Simple forms for entering medical information.
