Multiple Disease Prediction System
This project is a Streamlit web application that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases. The system currently includes prediction models for:

‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease

üß† Parkinson‚Äôs Disease

üç¨ Diabetes

Overview
The application is designed to be a user-friendly tool for early disease detection. It allows users to input various medical parameters like glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI. The system then uses pre-trained machine learning models to analyze this data and predict a person's risk for the selected disease.

The primary goal is to provide an accessible way for people to assess their risk and encourage preventive healthcare measures.

Tech Stack
Python: The core language for data processing and model training.

Streamlit: Used to build the interactive web application.

Scikit-learn: The primary library for the machine learning models.

Pandas & NumPy: Essential for data handling and manipulation.

Features
‚úÖ Heart Disease Prediction
